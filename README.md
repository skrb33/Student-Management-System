# System-Management-System
The system is a desktop application developed using Python with Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) and MySQL as the database for persistent data storage. The system allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) on student records. The architecture includes:

Frontend (GUI): Tkinter is used for the user interface, where users can input data and interact with the application.
Backend (Database): MySQL stores student data, including personal details and academic records.
Application Logic: Python code handles the business logic, interacting with the MySQL database to perform actions based on user input from the GUI.
